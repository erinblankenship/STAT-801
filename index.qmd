# Course Goals for STAT 801A

STAT 801A is an introduction to research methods, and how statistical methods may be used to answer research questions. By the end of the course, you will:

-   understand the role statistics plays in the research process, and how a statistical investigation works.

-   understand statistical evidence, and what conclusions may be drawn based on the evidence and study design.

-   be able to make simple probability calculations, and be able to differentiate a few different probability distributions based on the scenario.

-   understand that variablility is natural, and commonly used statistics such as the mean, variance, and others have their own probability distributions. Such a probability distribution is called a sampling distribution.

-   understand the underlying logic behind commonly used statistical inference techniques (hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).

-   realize that the most appropriate statistical inference method changes based on the explanatory variable(s), response variable, and goals of the study.

-   be able to calculate and interpret statistical analyses  for studies in which there is one (or fewer) explanatory variables.

-  be able to sketch a skeleton ANOVA table from a description of the study.

-  use statistical software appropriately.

-  be able to clearly write up the results of an analysis.
