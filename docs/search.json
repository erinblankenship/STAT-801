These steps appear in Tintle et al. (2021), but are not at all unique to this textbook.\nHow do you think the steps in a statistical investigation map to the scientific method?

Our textbook does a great job summarizing both numerical and graphical summaries of data (pages 30-73), including walking through how EDA can be used in several case studies.\nWe won’t spend a lot of time here, since these are mostly very familiar concepts (mean, median, etc.) However, we’ll go through a small example as a preview of coming attractions.\nExample: The Gettysburg Address is comprised of 268 words, with word lengths varying from 1 (“a”) to 11 (“consecrated”) letters.

    "text": "2.1 Probability Basics\nProbability is the language we use to talk about chance and quantify uncertainty. A probability is a number between 0 and 1, where an event is more likely the closer the probability is to 1.\nWe’ve already seen a probability! Back to the babies–when we considered how unusual it was to see 13/16 babies pick the good puppet, we calculated:\nThe value we calculated is a p-value: the (empirical) probability of observing what we did in the data (or something even more extreme), under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. For better or worse, science runs on p-values.\nIn this section, we’ll see some basic probability theory and calculations, as well as probability distributions.\nWhen we are uncertain about an outcome’s occurrence (e.g., whether a coin will come up heads or tails, the number of dots observed on the roll of a die, whether or not the bus will be late), we typically quantify this uncertainty with a probability. Probability is the foundation upon which all of statistics is built, and it a provides a framework for modeling populations, experiments, and almost anything that could be considered a random phenomenon.\nA sample space, denoted by \\(S\\), is comprised of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.\nAn event is a collection of possible outcomes. Each event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\).\nWe want to formalize the idea of the “chance” that event \\(A\\) occurs. We will do this by defining the probability of each \\(A\\), which we denote \\(P(A)\\).\nProbabilities are calculated by defining functions on sets, and should be defined for all possible events. One thing that must be true: \\[\n0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\n\\]\nMore formally, a probability function is defined as follows.\nGiven a sample space \\(S\\), a probability function is a function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies\nAny function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies these three requirements is called a probability function.\nIf we let \\(S\\) be a sample space with associated probability function P, we can state some basic facts. Let \\(A, B\\) be events in \\(S\\).\nWe’ll use these facts when calculating probabilities. First, however, we need to figure out how to assign probabilities to specific events. There are several ways we can do this.\nHowever we arrive at probabilities for a given scenario, we can use them to construct a probability distribution. There are several flavors of probability distribution. The simplest is a list of all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, and it must satisfy three rules:\nAny probability distribution that can be written this way corresponds to a discrete variable or one that we have discretized.\nWe’ll see some other (more common, but more complicated) flavors of probability distributions in a bit, after some facts and definitions.\nConsider the following table:\nThe counts in the table are the number of Titanic passengers that fell into each of the categories. From this table, we can calculate some probabilities.\nSometimes we have partial information about a certain event and wish to know how this affects the probablities of other events, if at all. For example, we might be interested in the probability a passenger survived, given they were in First Class. This is called conditional probability.\nDefinition:\nExample: Toss a fair die. Let \\(A=\\{1\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{1,3,5\\}\\). What is the probability of throwing a 1, given an odd number was thrown?\nThis definition of conditional probability leads to:\nLet \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) be a collection of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. What does this mean?\nSuppose we want the probability of an event \\(B\\).\nThis leads to the general form of Bayes’ Theorem:\nExample: (Problem 2.18) A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for thrombosis, which is a formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition. The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition. The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?\nConsider the following table, which summarizes all flights arriving at an airport in a single day:\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected flight on this day was on time?\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected flight was on time, given it was a domestic flight?\nWhat do you notice?\nDoes this make sense in the context of this scenario? What do you think it means?\nSometimes the occurrence of one event, \\(B\\), will have no effect on the probability of another event, \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are unrelated, then intuitively it should be the case\nAlso, it follows that\nDefinition:\nHow is independence used? Let’s do a pretty famous example. We’ll use a few of the rules we’ve seen so far.",

    "text": "2.2 Random Variables and Probability Distributions\nTypically we are interested in a numerical measurement of the outcome of a random experiment. For example, we might want to know the number of insects treated with a dose of a new insecticide that are killed. In this case, the outcome is the survival status of each dosed insect and the numerical measurement we’re interested in is the number that died. However, the observed number varies depending on the actual result of the experiment. This type of variable is called a random variable.\nDefinition: A random variable is a function that associates a real number with each element in the sample space. That is, a random variable is a function from a sample space, \\(S\\), into the real numbers.\nExample: Suppose we roll two dice and we’re interested in the number of 1s that are thrown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom variables can also be defined on a continuous range.\nExample: Take a 1 gram soil sample and measure the amount of phosphorus in the sample (in g).\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen one flavor of probability distribution: a list of possible outcomes for the random variable, and the associated probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can define probability distribution more generally.\nDefinition: A probability distribution is a function that is used to assign probability to each value the random variable can take on.\nMaybe that function can be written in tabular form, as above, maybe it’s a function in the mathematical function sense (we’ll see some of these later in this section). We can have probability distributions for discrete random variables and continuous random variables.\nDiscrete probability distributions\n\nProbabilities are denoted P\\((X=x)\\) for the realized value \\(x\\) of random variable \\(X\\)\n\\(\\sum_i\\) P\\((X=x_i)\\) = 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: We have two seeds in a Petri dish, and will observe how many germinate. We assume the seeds germinate independently, and the probability a randomly selected seed germinates is 0.80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous probability distributions\n\nThis distribution is called a probability density function (pdf) and denoted \\(f(x)\\).\nThe area bounded by \\(f(x)\\), the horizontal axis, and the values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is P\\((a \\leq X \\leq b)\\).\nThe total area under the pdf is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Let \\(X\\) = phosphorus in a 1 gram soil sample.

His theory indicates that if pure-line tall and pure-line short plants are cross-pollinated and then the hybrids in the next generation are cross-pollinated, in the resulting population approximately 3/4 of the plants will appear tall and 1/4 will appear short.

What is this Cov?\nCovariance is a measure of the linear relationship between two random variables. It can be positive or negative. A positive covariance indicates that as the value of one RV increases, so does the other. A negative covariance indicates that as the value of RV increases, the other decreases.\nFor discrete RVs, the covariance is calculated as\n\n\n\n\n\nIf two random variables are independent, the covariance is 0.\n\n\nFor our example, do you think covariance will be positive, negative, or 0?\nLet’s calculate it, and find the variance above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the units of measurement on covariance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes covariance less intuitive as a measure of dependence–its value depends on the scale of measurement.

We’re going to discuss some probability distributions that commonly arise in data analysis.\n\n2.3.1 The Binomial Distribution\nIn some studies, the variable of interest only has two potential outcomes: success and failure. These could be died/survived, yes/no, occurred/did not occur, picked the good puppet/picked the bad puppet. Under some very specific conditions, variables like these follow a theoretical probability distribution called the binomial distribution.\nHere are the conditions we need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf these conditions are met, the probability distribution of \\(X\\) = number of “successes” observed in \\(n\\) trials is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameter \\(p\\), then\n\n\n\n\nRight now, we’ll use the binomial distribution to calculate some probabilities assuming a specific value for \\(p\\), but inference for scenarios like this typically focuses on testing hypotheses about \\(p\\) (like the babies!) and estimating \\(p\\).\nExample: A new variety of turfgrass has been developed for use on golf courses, with the goal of obtaining a germination rate of 85%. To evaluate the grass, 20 seeds are planted in a greenhouse so that each seed will be exposed to identical conditions. If the 85% germination rate is correct, what is the probability that 18 or more seeds will germinate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many seeds do we expect to germinate? What is the variance of the number of germinated seeds?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 The Poisson Distribution\nThe Poisson distribution models count data, typically the number of events observed for a particular unit of time or space. For example, the Poisson can be used to model variables like:\n\nthe number of hits to a website per minute\nthe number of PCB particles in a liter of water\nthe number of insects in a square meter\nthe number of cars passing through an intersection in 5 minutes\nthe number of flaws in a yard of fabric\n\nLike the Binomial, the Poisson has some requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability distribution for the Poisson is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution has a couple of interesting features:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Suppose grasshoppers are distributed at random in a large field according to a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=2\\) grasshoppers per square meter.\n\nFind the probability that no grasshoppers will be found in a randomly selected square meter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the probability that 2 or fewer grasshoppers will be found in 2 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the expected number of grasshoppers in 10 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the expected number of grasshoppers in 0.5 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 The Normal Distribution\nThe most commonly used continuous distribution (maybe the most commonly used distribution, period) is the normal distribution. It’s commonly used because\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is bell-shaped, symmetric, and unimodal. In fact, we shouldn’t call it the normal distribution, there are an infinite number of different normal distributions, depending on the parameters of the distribution, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\\(\\mu\\) represents the mean of the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma^2\\) represents the variance of the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution does has a mathematical function (a pdf) that governs its shape:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe denote random variables following the normal as\n\n\n\nand the normal with mean \\(\\mu=0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=1\\) is called the standard normal distribution.\nThe standard normal gives us a convenient way to compare observations, and any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal. The Z-score is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Z-score is positive\n\n\nIf the Z-score is negative\n\n\nZ-scores can be used to\n\ngauge the unusualness of an observation\n\n\n\n\n\nfind probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nSome helpful R functions:\n\npnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)\nqnorm(prob, meam=0, sd=1)\n\n\n\n\nnormTail(m=0,s=1, L=x) or normTail(m=0,s=1,U=x) (does require the OpenIntro library)\n\nExample: Full-term birth weights for single babies are normally distributed with a mean of 7.5 pounds and a standard deviation of 1.1 pounds.\n\nA randomly selected newborn weighs 9.1 pounds. What is the weight percentile for this baby?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBabies that weigh less than 5.5 pounds are considered low birth weight. What proportion of babies are low birth weight?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat weight would make a baby at the 25th percentile?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected baby weighs between 7 and 8 pounds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Empirical Rule (aka the 68-95-99.7 Rule) presents a general rule for the probability of falling within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis rule is useful in a wide range of settings when trying to make a quick estimate.\nThe normal distribution is useful because it can be used to approximate other distributions, such as the binomial.\nLet’s see what happens with \\(p=0.15\\) as we change the sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall the binomial distribution has\n\n\nIf \\(n\\) is sufficiently large, the binomial can be well-approximated with a normal distibution with \\(\\mu=np\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = np(1-p)\\).\nWhat’s sufficiently large?\n\n\nExample: (problem 3.33) Suppose a university announced that it admitted 2500 students for the incoming first year class. However, the univesity has dorm room spots for only 1786 first year students. If there is a 70% chance an admitted student will enroll at the university, what is the probability the university will not have enough dorm room spots?",

    "text": "3.1 Sampling Distributions\nAs we’ve seen in the last two chapters, variability is natural and expected. We expect to see variability in observations, which implies there will also be variability in summary statistics. We’ve seen this already:\nIf we want to use a summary statistic (like \\(\\bar X\\) or \\(\\hat p\\)) calculated from our sample to draw inferences about the population, we have to understand how the summary statistic behaves.\nThis means, we need to know the sampling distribution of the statistic.\nAs a refresher, the goal of statistical inference is to use an observed data set to answer questions about the overall population from which the sample data set was drawn. Typically, those questions may be answered using some parameter(s) of the population distribution.\nA parameter is\nFor example,\nParameters are generally fixed, unknown constants. We want to use our sample data to answer a question about the parameter (hypothesis test) or estimate the parameter (confidence interval). We may also be interested in functions of parameters.\nOften, the statistic we’ll use to estimate the underlying parameter is pretty intuitive.\nBut, if we want to use a statistic, we have to understand its behavior.\nThe sampling distribution is\nWe’ve can study sampling distributions empirically, through simulation. We’ve already done this!\nWe can also quantify sampling distributions theoretically. We’ve already done this too!\nThe sampling distributions we’ve seen so far have been (mostly):\nThis isn’t coincidence it’s guaranteed by a very important theorem, the Central Limit Theorem.\nCentral Limit Theorem:\nBut wait, the sample mean? Weren’t we also considering sample proportions?\nLet’s think more about these requirements:\nIf the Central Limit Theorem holds, the underlying parameters of the resulting approximate normal distribution will depend on the population from which the original data were drawn.\nOther statistics will have sampling distributions that do not follow an approximate normal. For example, the sample variance is a natural estimate for the population variance. But, the CLT does not apply to variances. We’ll need a different distribution.\nOnce we can articulate the sampling distribution, we can use it to do statistical inference.",

    "section": "3.2 Foundations of Statistical Inference",
    "text": "3.2 Foundations of Statistical Inference\nIn Chapter One, we talked about framing a research question. Many (but not all) research questions can be answered using statistical inference. We’ll now lay out the basic logic of statistical inference, illustraing the different methods for the case in which we have a single response variable (quantitative or categorical) and no explanatory variable. The framework for statistical inference will not change as we move to more complicated scenarios.\nStatistical inference is a collection of techniques which use information from a sample to make precise statements about the entire population. In STAT 801A, the general statements about populations will be expressed in terms of the parameters, or functions of parameters, of probability distributions. Because we know the sampling distribution, we can use probability to precisely quantify the accuracy of our general statements.\nStatistical inference is broken into two broad categories: estimation and testing. These map back to the types of research questions we outlined in Chapter One.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Estimation\nThis category of statistical inference is concerned with using sample information to estimate one or more parameters, or functions of parameters, of the probability distribution for a population. For example, we may be interested in estimating the mean of a population, or the difference in means between two populations. There are two types of estimation, point estimation and interval estimation.\nPoint estimation\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a single value is not very meaningful without some way of telling how close our estimate comes to the true value.\nInterval estimation\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll illustrate how interval estimation works with an example.\nExample: An entomologist is studying a new tick species that may be the carrier of the pathogen associated with lyme disease. They design a study to estimate prevalence of the pathogen in the tick. They examine 200 ticks randomly selected in the study region during a period of the year when ticks have been known to be infected with the pathogen in other regions of the country. They find 18 ticks that are infected with the pathogen.\n\nParameter of interest:\n\n\n\n\n\nSample statistic:\n\n\n\n\nAre the requirements for the Central Limit Theorem met?\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem tells us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s consider the Empirical Rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost (but not all) confidence intervals have the form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, to calculate a confidence interval of this form we’ll need the margin of error, which is calculated based on the standard error of the statistic and the sampling distribution of the statistic. We’ll also need to specify how much certainly we want in our interval estimate.\n\n\n\n\nBack to the ticks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhat happens if we change our level of confidence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we want a confidence level that isn’t 68, 95, or 99.7?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s think more carefully about what this confidence level means. A confidence interval is a probability statement, but not the probability statement that is intuitive. Suppose we are interested in an interval estimate for a parameter \\(\\theta\\).\n\n\n\n\nIt’s super important to understand that this probability statement is only valid for as long as \\(L\\) and \\(U\\) are unknown. Once we use the data to estimate \\(L\\) and \\(U\\), and get \\(\\hat{L}\\) and \\(\\hat{U}\\), the interval is no longer random. The interval either contains the parameter or it doesn’t. This means statements like\n\n\n\n\n\nare incorrect, as tempting as they are to write. Rather, the statement of probability is about the method used to obtain the confidence interval.\nLet’s look at the applet to explore what that confidence level really means: Applet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, let’s find a 98% confidence interval for the proportion of ticks that are infected by the pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: (4.17, sort of) The nutrition label on a bag of potato chips says that a one ounce serving has 130 calories and 10 grams of fat. A random sample of 35 bags yielded a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}=134\\) calories with a sample standard deviation of \\(s = 17\\) calories. Assume the distribution of bags is relatively symmetric. We want a 95% confidence interval for the true mean calorie count of a bag of potato chips.\nWhat’s different about this example, compared to the tick example?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s state the Central Limit Theorem again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis presents a few complications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural fix is to use \\(s\\) (the sample standard deviation) in place of \\(\\sigma\\), so the standard error is\n\n\n\n\nBut this leads to yet another complication: the normal distribution isn’t quite right. Instead, we end up with a distribution that has heavier tails than the normal. Instead, we use the \\(t\\) distribution. The \\(t\\) distribution has a single parameter, the degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)). The degrees of freedom determines the shape of the \\(t\\), with the distribution getting closer and closer to the normal as the \\(df\\) increase.\n\n\n\nStandard normal compared to the t distribution with various df\n\n\nIn the scenario of a single mean, \\(df=n-1\\) but this will change as the scenario gets more complicated.\nWe can get \\(t\\) probabilities and quantiles using the R functions\n\npt(x, df=)\nqt(prob, df=)\n\nSo, if we’re interested in calculating an interval estimate for a mean\n\n\n\nBack to the potato chips example. Are the conditions for the Central Limit Theorem met?\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll calculate a 95% confidence interval.\n\nExample: An ichthyologist is interested in estimating the variance of lengths of trout minnows in a very large tank at a fish hatchery. It is reasonable to assume that lengths are normally distributed. 15 minnows are randomly sampled from the tank and measured. The sample variance is \\(s^2 = 0.17\\) inch\\(^2\\).\nWhat’s different now?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat complications does this present?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need a new distribution! We need the sampling distribution of \\(S^2\\). It turns out that a function of \\(S^2\\) follows the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. The \\(\\chi^2\\) has the following properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our original observations come from a normal distribution, then\n\n\n\nThis gives us a straightforward way to find a confidence interval for \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find these \\(\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2}\\) and \\(\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2}\\) using the qchisq(prob,df=) function in R. For example,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is one of the cases where the confidence interval does not have the estimate \\(\\pm\\) margin of error form. That’s because the \\(\\chi^2\\) isn’t symmetric. But, we now have all the information we need to calculate the confidence interval for the variance in trout length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word of warning. This is not a robust procedure. If the assumption of normality is not met, this interval will give poor results. This is not true of the \\(t\\) interval for the mean.\n\n\n3.2.2 Hypothesis Testing\nThe goal of hypothesis tests is to use an observed data set to answer a yes/no question about a characteristic of a larger population from which the observed data set was drawn.\nFor example, let’s consider the ticks again. The entomologist knows from a literature review that the prevalence of the lyme disease pathogen in the black-legged tick is 0.02. They are interested in whether the presence of the pathogen is more prevalent in the new tick species. The yes/no question we will answer is whether the resulting data provide convincing evidence that the pathogen is more prevalent in the new species. These questions lead to two competing claims, both stated in terms of parameters of a probability distribution\n\nNull hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will choose between the competing claims by assessing whether the data conflict so much with H\\(_0\\) that the null hypothesis cannot be considered reasonable. If this happens, we’ll reject the notion of H\\(_0\\) and conclude that H\\(_a\\) must be true. We will NEVER conclude that the null hypothesis is true.\nHypothesis tests work by assuming the null hypothesis is true, and assessing the plausibility of the observed data under that assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entomologist examined 200 ticks randomly selected from the study region. If we assume the null hypothesis is true, then we expect to see\n\n\n\nIn fact, 18/200 ticks were infected with the pathogen. The question then becomes\n\n\n\n\nTo see how unusual this sample result of 18/200 is, we again need the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. As a reminder, the Central Limit Theorem says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we can use normal distribution to see how unusual 18/200 is, if the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Let’s consider the potato chip example again. The bag claims that a serving contains 130 calories. We want to test whether this is true. This leads to the hypotheses\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s different here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can again appeal to the Central Limit Theorem and the \\(t\\) distribution to characterize the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{X}\\), which leads to the test statistic\n\n\n\n\n\nThe random sample of 35 bags had a sample mean of \\(\\bar{x}=134\\) and standard deviation \\(s=17\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now what is “more unusual” assuming the null hypothesis is true?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen in doubt, use a two-sided test! Use a one-sided test only if you truly have interest in only one direction. Why? To fully answer this, we need to address decision errors.\nAnytime we’re using sample data to make decisions about a larger population we can potentially make a mistake. We can make an incorrect decision in a hypothesis test or calculate a confidence interval that does not capture the true population parameter. In a hypothesis test, there are four possible outcomes at the outset of the study:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType I error:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType II error:\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples:\n\nDoping in the Olympics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriminal trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic test for a serious disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors require a balancing act. We want to reduce the chance of making a Type I error but this will necessarily increase the chance of making a Type II error. The best we can do is to set the probability of a Type I error. We can do this through setting the significance level.\nSignificance level:\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does this fit in with one- and two-sided hypotheses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow else can we control Type I error?\n\nSet up tests before seeing the data.\nCollect enough data that the test has sufficient power. Power is the probability of correcting rejecting a false null hypothesis. It’s a function of how big the true difference is (which we don’t know and can’t control), the expected variability in our responses (also can’t control, but might know), and the sample size (which we can control). We’ll talk more about power later on in the semester.\n\nThe two examples we’ve seen have both utilized a test statistic with the form\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith confidence intervals, we mentioned that many confidence intervals have the form estimate \\(\\pm\\) margin of error, but not all do. We saw an example, a confidence interval for a variance, that had a different form. Similarly, many tests have a test statistic of the form\n\\[\n\\frac{\\hbox{estimate - hypothesized value}}{\\hbox{standard error of estimate}}\n\\]\nbut not all do.\nExample: The Poisson distribution is often a good model for scenarios in which we are counting occurrences over some specified time or space unit. However, the Poisson distribution has the characteristic that the population mean = population variance. In some scenarios, this may not be true, invalidating the Poisson as a possible model. We can use hypothesis testing to determine if the Poisson is a reaonable model for a data set. A scientist is interested in modeling the number of parasites found on a host, and believes the Poisson may be a feasible model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researcher examines 80 host organisms, and records the number of parasites found on each. The data are:\n\n\n\nNumber of Parasites\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hosts\n20\n28\n19\n9\n3\n1\n\n\n\nThere is not a single mean or proportion (or variance) we can calculate here that will summarize how closely these data follow a Poisson distribution. Instead, we’ll need to come up with a new test statistic.\nThe first thing we’ll need is an estimate of the Poisson parameter, \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we consider the Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda = 1.375\\) we can calculate some probabilities:\n\n\n\nX\nProbability\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.2528\n\n\n1\n0.3477\n\n\n2\n0.2390\n\n\n3\n0.1095\n\n\n4\n0.0377\n\n\n5\n0.0104\n\n\nover 5\n0.0029\n\n\n\nIf the Poisson distribution is a realistic model, we would expect to see our data fall into these categories in about these proportions. So, we expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Parasites\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n&gt;5\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hosts\n20\n28\n19\n9\n3\n1\n0\n\n\nExpected\n20.224\n27.816\n19.12\n8.76\n3.016\n0.832\n0.232\n\n\n\nand we can compare the observed counts to the expected counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Parasites\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n&gt;5\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hosts\n20\n28\n19\n9\n3\n1\n0\n\n\nExpected\n20.224\n27.816\n19.12\n8.76\n3.016\n0.832\n0.232\n\n\nDifference\n-0.224\n0.184\n-0.12\n0.24\n-0.016\n0.168\n-0.232\n\n\n\nBut we’ve got another problem.\n\n\n\n\nAgain, our solution will be squaring! This time we’ll also scale. The resulting test statistic is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is called the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. Under the null hypothesis, this test statistic will follow a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom, where \\(k\\) is the number of categories. However, we also need a big enough sample so that all expected counts are at least 5. That’s not true here. What now?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Parasites\n0\n1\n2\n\\(\\geq\\) 3\n\n\n\n\nNumber of hosts\n20\n28\n19\n13\n\n\nExpected\n20.224\n27.816\n19.12\n12.84\n\n\nDifference\n-0.224\n0.184\n-0.12\n0.16\n\n\n\nSo now,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also easily do this in R:\n\nhost&lt;-c(20,28,19,9, 3, 1, 0)\nchisq.test(host,p=c(0.2528, 0.3477, 0.2390, 0.1095, 0.0377, 0.0104, 0.0029))\n\nWarning in chisq.test(host, p = c(0.2528, 0.3477, 0.239, 0.1095, 0.0377, :\nChi-squared approximation may be incorrect\n\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  host\nX-squared = 0.27703, df = 6, p-value = 0.9996\n\n\nSo R is telling us our sample size isn’t big enough for the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution to work. Like we did by hand, we can collapse some categories.\n\nhost&lt;-c(20,28,19,13)\nchisq.test(host,p=c(0.2528, 0.3477, 0.2390, 0.1605))\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  host\nX-squared = 0.0064451, df = 3, p-value = 0.9999\n\n\nSo it appears we have no reason to doubt that the Poisson distribution is a good model for these data.\nNow that we’ve seen the logic behind statistical inference, we can move on to more complicated situations. We’ll consider cases in which we have a single explanatory variable and a single response variable. We’ll first cover the case where the explanatory variable is categorical with only two levels, and the response variable is either categorical or numeric (comparing two groups). We’ll then move on to the case where the the explanatory variable is categorical with more than two levels, and the response variable is categorical or numeric. Finally, we’ll consider the case where the explanatory and response variable are both numeric.",
