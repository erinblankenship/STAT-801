These steps appear in Tintle et al. (2021), but are not at all unique to this textbook.\nHow do you think the steps in a statistical investigation map to the scientific method?

Our textbook does a great job summarizing both numerical and graphical summaries of data (pages 30-73), including walking through how EDA can be used in several case studies.\nWe won’t spend a lot of time here, since these are mostly very familiar concepts (mean, median, etc.) However, we’ll go through a small example as a preview of coming attractions.\nExample: The Gettysburg Address is comprised of 268 words, with word lengths varying from 1 (“a”) to 11 (“consecrated”) letters.

    "text": "2.1 Probability Basics\nProbability is the language we use to talk about chance and quantify uncertainty. A probability is a number between 0 and 1, where an event is more likely the closer the probability is to 1.\nWe’ve already seen a probability! Back to the babies–when we considered how unusual it was to see 13/16 babies pick the good puppet, we calculated:\nThe value we calculated is a p-value: the (empirical) probability of observing what we did in the data (or something even more extreme), under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. For better or worse, science runs on p-values.\nIn this section, we’ll see some basic probability theory and calculations, as well as probability distributions.\nWhen we are uncertain about an outcome’s occurrence (e.g., whether a coin will come up heads or tails, the number of dots observed on the roll of a die, whether or not the bus will be late), we typically quantify this uncertainty with a probability. Probability is the foundation upon which all of statistics is built, and it a provides a framework for modeling populations, experiments, and almost anything that could be considered a random phenomenon.\nA sample space, denoted by \\(S\\), is comprised of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon.\nAn event is a collection of possible outcomes. Each event \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(S\\).\nWe want to formalize the idea of the “chance” that event \\(A\\) occurs. We will do this by defining the probability of each \\(A\\), which we denote \\(P(A)\\).\nProbabilities are calculated by defining functions on sets, and should be defined for all possible events. One thing that must be true: \\[\n0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\n\\]\nMore formally, a probability function is defined as follows.\nGiven a sample space \\(S\\), a probability function is a function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies\nAny function P(\\(\\cdot\\)) that satisfies these three requirements is called a probability function.\nIf we let \\(S\\) be a sample space with associated probability function P, we can state some basic facts. Let \\(A, B\\) be events in \\(S\\).\nWe’ll use these facts when calculating probabilities. First, however, we need to figure out how to assign probabilities to specific events. There are several ways we can do this.\nHowever we arrive at probabilities for a given scenario, we can use them to construct a probability distribution. There are several flavors of probability distribution. The simplest is a list of all possible outcomes and their associated probabilities, and it must satisfy three rules:\nAny probability distribution that can be written this way corresponds to a discrete variable or one that we have discretized.\nWe’ll see some other (more common, but more complicated) flavors of probability distributions in a bit, after some facts and definitions.\nConsider the following table:\nThe counts in the table are the number of Titanic passengers that fell into each of the categories. From this table, we can calculate some probabilities.\nSometimes we have partial information about a certain event and wish to know how this affects the probablities of other events, if at all. For example, we might be interested in the probability a passenger survived, given they were in First Class. This is called conditional probability.\nDefinition:\nExample: Toss a fair die. Let \\(A=\\{1\\}\\) and let \\(B=\\{1,3,5\\}\\). What is the probability of throwing a 1, given an odd number was thrown?\nThis definition of conditional probability leads to:\nLet \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots\\) be a collection of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. What does this mean?\nSuppose we want the probability of an event \\(B\\).\nThis leads to the general form of Bayes’ Theorem:\nExample: (Problem 2.18) A genetic test is used to determine if people have a predisposition for thrombosis, which is a formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel that obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. It is believed that 3% of people actually have this predisposition. The genetic test is 99% accurate if a person actually has the predisposition. The test is 98% accurate if a person does not have the predisposition.\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected person who tests positive for the predisposition by the test actually has the predisposition?\nConsider the following table, which summarizes all flights arriving at an airport in a single day:\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected flight on this day was on time?\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected flight was on time, given it was a domestic flight?\nWhat do you notice?\nDoes this make sense in the context of this scenario? What do you think it means?\nSometimes the occurrence of one event, \\(B\\), will have no effect on the probability of another event, \\(A\\). If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are unrelated, then intuitively it should be the case\nAlso, it follows that\nDefinition:\nHow is independence used? Let’s do a pretty famous example. We’ll use a few of the rules we’ve seen so far.",

    "text": "2.2 Random Variables and Probability Distributions\nTypically we are interested in a numerical measurement of the outcome of a random experiment. For example, we might want to know the number of insects treated with a dose of a new insecticide that are killed. In this case, the outcome is the survival status of each dosed insect and the numerical measurement we’re interested in is the number that died. However, the observed number varies depending on the actual result of the experiment. This type of variable is called a random variable.\nDefinition: A random variable is a function that associates a real number with each element in the sample space. That is, a random variable is a function from a sample space, \\(S\\), into the real numbers.\nExample: Suppose we roll two dice and we’re interested in the number of 1s that are thrown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom variables can also be defined on a continuous range.\nExample: Take a 1 gram soil sample and measure the amount of phosphorus in the sample (in g).\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen one flavor of probability distribution: a list of possible outcomes for the random variable, and the associated probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can define probability distribution more generally.\nDefinition: A probability distribution is a function that is used to assign probability to each value the random variable can take on.\nMaybe that function can be written in tabular form, as above, maybe it’s a function in the mathematical function sense (we’ll see some of these later in this section). We can have probability distributions for discrete random variables and continuous random variables.\nDiscrete probability distributions\n\nProbabilities are denoted P\\((X=x)\\) for the realized value \\(x\\) of random variable \\(X\\)\n\\(\\sum_i\\) P\\((X=x_i)\\) = 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: We have two seeds in a Petri dish, and will observe how many germinate. We assume the seeds germinate independently, and the probability a randomly selected seed germinates is 0.80.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous probability distributions\n\nThis distribution is called a probability density function (pdf) and denoted \\(f(x)\\).\nThe area bounded by \\(f(x)\\), the horizontal axis, and the values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is P\\((a \\leq X \\leq b)\\).\nThe total area under the pdf is 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Let \\(X\\) = phosphorus in a 1 gram soil sample.

His theory indicates that if pure-line tall and pure-line short plants are cross-pollinated and then the hybrids in the next generation are cross-pollinated, in the resulting population approximately 3/4 of the plants will appear tall and 1/4 will appear short.

What is this Cov?\nCovariance is a measure of the linear relationship between two random variables. It can be positive or negative. A positive covariance indicates that as the value of one RV increases, so does the other. A negative covariance indicates that as the value of RV increases, the other decreases.\nFor discrete RVs, the covariance is calculated as\n\n\n\n\n\nIf two random variables are independent, the covariance is 0.\n\n\nFor our example, do you think covariance will be positive, negative, or 0?\nLet’s calculate it, and find the variance above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the units of measurement on covariance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes covariance less intuitive as a measure of dependence–its value depends on the scale of measurement.

We’re going to discuss some probability distributions that commonly arise in data analysis.\n\n2.3.1 The Binomial Distribution\nIn some studies, the variable of interest only has two potential outcomes: success and failure. These could be died/survived, yes/no, occurred/did not occur, picked the good puppet/picked the bad puppet. Under some very specific conditions, variables like these follow a theoretical probability distribution called the binomial distribution.\nHere are the conditions we need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf these conditions are met, the probability distribution of \\(X\\) = number of “successes” observed in \\(n\\) trials is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(X\\) follows a binomial distribution with parameter \\(p\\), then\n\n\n\n\nRight now, we’ll use the binomial distribution to calculate some probabilities assuming a specific value for \\(p\\), but inference for scenarios like this typically focuses on testing hypotheses about \\(p\\) (like the babies!) and estimating \\(p\\).\nExample: A new variety of turfgrass has been developed for use on golf courses, with the goal of obtaining a germination rate of 85%. To evaluate the grass, 20 seeds are planted in a greenhouse so that each seed will be exposed to identical conditions. If the 85% germination rate is correct, what is the probability that 18 or more seeds will germinate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many seeds do we expect to germinate? What is the variance of the number of germinated seeds?\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 The Poisson Distribution\nThe Poisson distribution models count data, typically the number of events observed for a particular unit of time or space. For example, the Poisson can be used to model variables like:\n\nthe number of hits to a website per minute\nthe number of PCB particles in a liter of water\nthe number of insects in a square meter\nthe number of cars passing through an intersection in 5 minutes\nthe number of flaws in a yard of fabric\n\nLike the Binomial, the Poisson has some requirements:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe probability distribution for the Poisson is\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution has a couple of interesting features:\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Suppose grasshoppers are distributed at random in a large field according to a Poisson distribution with \\(\\lambda=2\\) grasshoppers per square meter.\n\nFind the probability that no grasshoppers will be found in a randomly selected square meter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the probability that 2 or fewer grasshoppers will be found in 2 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the expected number of grasshoppers in 10 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the expected number of grasshoppers in 0.5 square meters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 The Normal Distribution\nThe most commonly used continuous distribution (maybe the most commonly used distribution, period) is the normal distribution. It’s commonly used because\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is bell-shaped, symmetric, and unimodal. In fact, we shouldn’t call it the normal distribution, there are an infinite number of different normal distributions, depending on the parameters of the distribution, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\n\n\\(\\mu\\) represents the mean of the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma^2\\) represents the variance of the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution does has a mathematical function (a pdf) that governs its shape:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe denote random variables following the normal as\n\n\n\nand the normal with mean \\(\\mu=0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2=1\\) is called the standard normal distribution.\nThe standard normal gives us a convenient way to compare observations, and any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal. The Z-score is\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Z-score is positive\n\n\nIf the Z-score is negative\n\n\nZ-scores can be used to\n\ngauge the unusualness of an observation\n\n\n\n\n\nfind probabilities\n\n\n\n\n\nSome helpful R functions:\n\npnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)\nqnorm(prob, meam=0, sd=1)\n\n\n\n\nnormTail(m=0,s=1, L=x) or normTail(m=0,s=1,U=x) (does require the OpenIntro library)\n\nExample: Full-term birth weights for single babies are normally distributed with a mean of 7.5 pounds and a standard deviation of 1.1 pounds.\n\nA randomly selected newborn weighs 9.1 pounds. What is the weight percentile for this baby?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBabies that weigh less than 5.5 pounds are considered low birth weight. What proportion of babies are low birth weight?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat weight would make a baby at the 25th percentile?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability a randomly selected baby weighs between 7 and 8 pounds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Empirical Rule (aka the 68-95-99.7 Rule) presents a general rule for the probability of falling within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis rule is useful in a wide range of settings when trying to make a quick estimate.\nThe normal distribution is useful because it can be used to approximate other distributions, such as the binomial.\nLet’s see what happens with \\(p=0.15\\) as we change the sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall the binomial distribution has\n\n\nIf \\(n\\) is sufficiently large, the binomial can be well-approximated with a normal distibution with \\(\\mu=np\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = np(1-p)\\).\nWhat’s sufficiently large?\n\n\nExample: (problem 3.33) Suppose a university announced that it admitted 2500 students for the incoming first year class. However, the univesity has dorm room spots for only 1786 first year students. If there is a 70% chance an admitted student will enroll at the university, what is the probability the university will not have enough dorm room spots?",
